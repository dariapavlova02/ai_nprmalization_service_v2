# Code Refactoring Strategy for AI Service

## Current Status Assessment

### âœ… Already Completed:
1. **Factory Pattern**: `NormalizationFactory` exists and coordinates processors
2. **Component Extraction**: Several processors already extracted:
   - `TokenProcessor` - handles tokenization
   - `RoleClassifier` - handles role classification
   - `MorphologyProcessor` - handles morphological analysis
   - `GenderProcessor` - handles gender inference and adjustment
3. **Error Handling**: `ErrorReportingMixin` provides centralized error handling
4. **Configuration**: `NormalizationConfig` dataclass for configuration management

### ðŸ”„ Remaining Issues:

1. **Massive Service Class**: `NormalizationService` is still 4,489 lines with 67 methods
2. **Mixed Responsibilities**: Old service still handles everything alongside new processors
3. **Legacy Code**: Old methods still exist and may conflict with new architecture
4. **Integration Gap**: Main service doesn't fully utilize new factory pattern
5. **Test Migration**: Tests may still target the old monolithic service

### Refactoring Goals (Updated):

1. **Complete migration to new processor architecture**
2. **Remove legacy code from monolithic service**
3. **Ensure full integration with existing factory**
4. **Migrate tests to new architecture**
5. **Optimize performance through better coordination**

## Updated Refactoring Plan

### Phase 1: Integration and Migration âœ… (Partially Complete)

#### 1.1 Processor Architecture âœ…
- âœ… `TokenProcessor` class extracted
- âœ… `RoleClassifier` class extracted
- âœ… `MorphologyProcessor` class extracted
- âœ… `GenderProcessor` class extracted
- âœ… `NormalizationFactory` coordinates all processors

#### 1.2 Still Needed:
- ðŸ”„ Integrate factory into main `NormalizationService`
- ðŸ”„ Remove duplicate code from main service
- ðŸ”„ Add missing processors for specialized operations

### Phase 2: Legacy Code Removal

#### 2.1 Main Service Refactoring
- Replace monolithic methods with factory calls
- Remove duplicate processing logic
- Keep only high-level orchestration
- Maintain backward compatibility

#### 2.2 Method Migration
- Migrate remaining 67 methods to appropriate processors
- Remove or refactor complex internal methods
- Simplify public API

### Phase 3: Enhanced Architecture

#### 3.1 Missing Components
- Extract `TextReconstructor` class for complex reconstruction
- Extract `PersonGrouper` class for multi-person handling
- Extract `CacheManager` class for better cache coordination

#### 3.2 Performance Optimizations
- Implement better caching strategies across processors
- Add batch processing capabilities
- Optimize async processing patterns

### Phase 3: Performance Optimizations

#### 3.1 Caching Improvements
- Extract `CacheManager` class
- Implement better cache strategies
- Add cache statistics and monitoring

#### 3.2 Async Processing
- Implement proper async/await patterns
- Add batch processing capabilities

### Phase 4: Code Quality Improvements

#### 4.1 Method Extraction
- Break down large methods (>50 lines)
- Extract helper methods with clear purposes
- Reduce parameter counts

#### 4.2 Data Structure Improvements
- Replace tuples with proper data classes
- Use type hints consistently
- Improve error handling

## Implementation Order

### Sprint 1: Core Extraction (Week 1)
1. Extract `TokenProcessor` class
2. Extract `RoleTaggingService` class
3. Update tests to work with new structure
4. Ensure no regression in functionality

### Sprint 2: Morphology Refactoring (Week 2)
1. Extract `MorphologyManager` class
2. Extract `GenderAnalyzer` class
3. Extract `DiminutiveResolver` class
4. Optimize caching mechanisms

### Sprint 3: Language Processing (Week 3)
1. Extract language-specific processors
2. Implement strategy pattern
3. Add factory for processor creation
4. Update configuration management

### Sprint 4: Reconstruction & Integration (Week 4)
1. Extract `TextReconstructor` class
2. Extract `PersonGrouper` class
3. Integrate all components
4. Performance testing and optimization

## Expected Benefits

### Code Quality
- **Reduced complexity**: From 4,489 lines to multiple focused classes
- **Better testability**: Each component can be tested in isolation
- **Improved maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Enhanced readability**: Smaller, focused methods

### Performance
- **Better caching**: Specialized cache managers
- **Reduced memory usage**: More efficient data structures
- **Faster processing**: Optimized algorithms

### Development Experience
- **Easier debugging**: Clear component boundaries
- **Faster feature development**: Well-defined interfaces
- **Better error handling**: Isolated error contexts
- **Improved documentation**: Focused component docs

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Comprehensive Testing**: Maintain 100% test coverage during refactoring
2. **Incremental Approach**: Small, atomic changes with immediate testing
3. **Feature Flags**: Use flags to enable/disable new code paths
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring during refactoring
5. **Rollback Strategy**: Ability to quickly revert any problematic changes

## Success Metrics

- **Code Complexity**: Reduce cyclomatic complexity by 60%
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain >95% coverage throughout
- **Performance**: No degradation in processing time
- **Memory Usage**: Reduce memory footprint by 20%
- **Developer Velocity**: Faster feature development post-refactoring
